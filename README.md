# Beaded-Curtain-Opener
Device to open a beaded curtain at the touch of a button.

## Description

I created this device because I have a roommate who has to hear my loud beaded curtain every time I arrive home late or go to classes early. It runs off an Arduino Nano using an Elegoo stepper motor, driver, and button. When the button is pressed once the beaded curtain opens and stays open until the button is pressed again.

- [4 inch female-female jumper wires](https://www.amazon.com/LAFVIN-Board-ATmega328P-Micro-Controller-Arduino/dp/B07G99NNXL/ref=sr_1_3?crid=2H5P3CA03PYLH&keywords=arduino+nano&qid=1699939818&s=industrial&sprefix=arduino+nano%2Cindustrial%2C117&sr=1-3), or all wires could be soldered

## Tips for assembly
- On the Arduino Nano clip or desolder the 6 pins opposite of the USB end as it makes it much easier to fit in the box.
- Make sure to print the spool with easily detachable supports, if the edges are rough the fishing line can get caught.
- After inserting the button into the slot, bend the bottom two pins downward, and solder the top two slots to two independent wires.
